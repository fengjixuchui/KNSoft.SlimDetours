# Update Threads Automatically When Applying Inline Hooks

## The necessity of updating threads when applying inline hooks

An inline hook must modify the instructions at the beginning of a function to implement the jump. To handle the possibility that a thread is running on the instruction being modified, the thread in this state must be updated so that it does not execute an invalid mixture of old and new instructions.

## Implementations in other hooking libraries

### Detours

[Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) provides the [`DetourUpdateThread`](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/wiki/DetourUpdateThread) function to update threads, but it requires the caller to pass the handle of the thread that needs to be updated:
```C
LONG WINAPI DetourUpdateThread(_In_ HANDLE hThread);
```
In other words, the caller needs to traverse all threads in the process except itself and pass them to this function, which is complicated and inconvenient to use.

[Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) updates threads very precisely. It accurately adjusts the PC (Program Counter) in the thread context to the correct position by using [`GetThreadContext`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getthreadcontext) and [`SetThreadContext`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadcontext); see [Detours/src/detours.cpp at 4b8c659f · microsoft/Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/blob/4b8c659f549b0ab21cf649377c7a84eb708f5e68/src/detours.cpp#L1840-L1906) for the implementation.

However, [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) still has gaps in thread updating on x64; see [PR #344: Improve thread program counter adjustment](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/pull/344), which I submitted for this issue.

> [!TIP]
> Although the official example "[Using Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/wiki/Using-Detours)" contains code such as `DetourUpdateThread(GetCurrentThread())`, this usage is pointless and invalid. It should be used to update all threads in the process except the current thread; see [`DetourUpdateThread`](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/wiki/DetourUpdateThread). But even when threads are updated in the right way, a new risk is introduced; see [🔗 TechWiki: Avoid Heap Deadlocks When Updating Threads](https://github.com/KNSoft/KNSoft.SlimDetours/blob/main/Docs/TechWiki/Avoid%20Heap%20Deadlocks%20When%20Updating%20Threads/README.md).

### MinHook

[MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) does a better job. It calls [CreateToolhelp32Snapshot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/tlhelp32/nf-tlhelp32-createtoolhelp32snapshot) to obtain other threads and updates them automatically when setting (or unsetting) hooks, then adjusts the PC (Program Counter) in the thread context as accurately as [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) does.

### mhook

[mhook](https://github.com/martona/mhook) calls [NtQuerySystemInformation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation) to obtain other threads and updates them automatically when setting (or unsetting) hooks. But its way of updating threads is more hacky: if the thread is exactly in the area where the instruction is about to be modified, it waits 100ms and tries up to three times. See [mhook/mhook-lib/mhook.cpp at e58a58ca · martona/mhook](https://github.com/martona/mhook/blob/e58a58ca31dbe14f202b9b26315bff9f7a32598c/mhook-lib/mhook.cpp#L557-L631) for the implementation:
```C
while (GetThreadContext(hThread, &ctx))
{
    ...
    if (nTries < 3)
    {
        // oops - we should try to get the instruction pointer out of here. 
        ODPRINTF((L"mhooks: SuspendOneThread: suspended thread %d - IP is at %p - IS COLLIDING WITH CODE", dwThreadId, pIp));
        ResumeThread(hThread);
        Sleep(100);
        SuspendThread(hThread);
        nTries++;
    }
    ...
}
```

## SlimDetours' implementation

[SlimDetours](https://github.com/KNSoft/KNSoft.SlimDetours) has two methods to obtain other threads. It calls [NtQuerySystemInformation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation) when targeting NT5, but uses `NtGetNextThread` when targeting NT6+ (the default) to significantly improve performance and correctness guarantees.

Thread updating follows [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours), with some fixes and improvements.

Key points:
1. Call `NtGetNextThread` to enumerate all threads of the current process
2. Call `NtSuspendThread` to suspend all threads except the current thread
3. Modify the instruction to implement the inline hook
4. Update the threads that were successfully suspended
5. Call `NtResumeThread` to resume the suspended threads

See [KNSoft.SlimDetours/Source/KNSoft.SlimDetours/Thread.c at main · KNSoft/KNSoft.SlimDetours](../../../Source/KNSoft.SlimDetours/Thread.c) for the full implementation.
